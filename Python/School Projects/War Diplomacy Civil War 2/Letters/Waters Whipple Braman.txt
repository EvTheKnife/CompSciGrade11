Camp of 93d N.Y.V.
Near Gettysburg Pa.
July 5th, 1863

Dear Uncle,

… We have had an awful fight here, but thank the Lord, our Army has given the Rebels an ever-lasting thrashing. The heaviest fighting was yesterday, and to-day they are in full retreat, and our army entire is after them. This is the first time since the organization of the army of the Potomac that the rebels have met our men in open field, fight, and I don't believe they would this time but that (as the prisoners say) their officers told them they were to fight the militia, but they found to their cost that the old army of the Potomac was around. We must have taken about 8,000 prisoners. The loss in killed and wounded on both sides must be 25,000, and some say the rebels alone have lost that number. Gen'l Lee tried to come the flag of truce game on Gen'l Meade, but it failed to work. Gen'l Meade sent back that he would bury their dead for them.

We are encamped about ½ a mile from Gettysburg, right on the Battlefield which is very large. I have seen but very little of it, as we have been momentarily under orders to be ready to move …
